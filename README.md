1. Alternate Strike out problem : 
  People are sitting on round table and we have knock out each of one in alternate order eg 1 2 3 4 5 6.These 6 people are sitting in circular table. If we knock out 2 first. Output should be 2 4 6 3 1 5

2. Generic Linked List:
  Linked list which can store different type of data types in different nodes. i.e one node containing integer, other node containing float or char data. 
  eg : 1 -> 2.34 -> r -> a -> k -> e -> s -> h -> 3.0 -> 1000

3. strtok() implementation
  Implement strtok functions of strings.
  eg: if input string is ”ab-cd-e” and delimiter is "-"
  Output should be 3 strings–“ab”, “cd” and “e” if we consider the delimiter as ‘-’
